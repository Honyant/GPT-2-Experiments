# GPT-2 Experiments
I was really interested in GPT-2, so I tried a few experiments mainly based off of the notebook, "Train a GPT-2 Text-Generating Model w/ GPU For Free" by [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com)

## GPT-2 for music generation
I didn't know it at the time, but using transformers for music generation had already been done many times, but I was interested, so I converted from midi to text and trained it on GPT-2 to see what I could get. The results weren't very good, but it was a good learning experience.
